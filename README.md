This is a simple Java implementation of the C algorithm in the
pdf paper within this directory.

Use it to read about the elegant C code that inspired this, and the 
java implementation I wrote.

If you'd like, add a bunch of tests. And then submit a pull request.

There is also a sift implementation. Who wants to give me a python one?
